I was surprised how little the preparation materials were actually referred to, although they were clearly an underlying part of what we were doing..

I found the fact that asking others questions instead of suggestions kept everything focused for the group and by doing so enables the leader to evaluate their own work and then take away and reflect on it. It was good you were given information to work with at each session whether you used it or brought your own situation was both beneficial. Having others from different areas of ministry both clergy and lay,  was great, it brought with it a humility that was tangible in the group and I felt supported by all and able to speak freely without feeling intimidated even though we were on Zoom.   Overall a positive experience, and a good learning platform. ",All of it,Agree,No,Yes,"Yes, somewhat",By allowing myself  to listen more to what is going on practically. Observing  what could be the possible struggles giving space for others to speak.  How to challenge myself in how to approach leadership with others that allows effective working. ,Agree,,Strongly agree,"A very good resource, especially meeting others on Zoom from different parts of the country you would never otherwise meet, who als want to learn more of leadership.

Some expected a talk with answers given!  For me, that was one of the strengths of the approach. With the Dig Deeper material I was able to listen to talks and lectures, which I find helpful, but reflect on aspects of the subject that were useful to me.",All of it,Agree,Yes,Yes,"Yes, somewhat",We looked at Healthy Leadership and it has made me appreciate the continual need to lead with an attitude of love. In leadership it is so easy to move away from that.,Agree,"It took some time to grasp how the course works because its approach was not familiar, e.g. no lecture or detailed questions to guide participants through the material. But once underway it did become clear!",Aagree,"Jayne was very helpful in her assessment and summary of each participant's presentation, as also in her questions and guidance of discussion where needed. Not everyone in the group was as familiar with the idea of asking questions and giving feedback, but overall the group worked very well."
